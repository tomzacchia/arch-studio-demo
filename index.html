    Home Portfolio About Us Contact Project Paramour Project made for an art
    museum near Southwest London. Project Paramour is a statement of bold,
    modern architecture. See Our Portfolio Seraph Station The Seraph Station
    project challenged us to design a unique station that would transport people
    through time. The result is a fresh and futuristic model inspired by space
    stations. See Our Portfolio Federal II Tower A sequel theme project for a
    tower originally built in the 1800s. We achieved this with a striking look
    of brutal minimalism with modern touches. See Our Portfolio Trinity Bank
    Tower Trinity Bank challenged us to make a concept for a 84 story building
    located in the middle of a city with a high earthquake frequency. For this
    project we used curves to blend design and stability to meet our objectives.
